# Manara Platform — Frontend

React 18 + Vite frontend for the Manara media platform (videos/books/articles). Plain JavaScript (`.jsx`, not TypeScript). RTL (Arabic) throughout. Backend lives at `/Users/kareemismail/IdeaProjects/manara-platform` (separate repo, has its own `CLAUDE.md`).

The repo directory is still named `elhamy-frontend-enhanced` (old project name) and `.idea/` project files still reference it — cosmetic leftovers, not renamed. `package.json`'s `name` field is `manara-frontend`.

Keep this file updated when architecture/conventions change — not a changelog for every commit, just what a fresh session would otherwise have to re-derive by reading everything.

## Styling: Tailwind CSS

Fully migrated from hand-rolled inline `style={{}}` objects to Tailwind (`tailwind.config.js`). Brand palette is defined as Tailwind theme tokens — primary green `#0D6B4D`, gold `#D4AF37` — under `colors.primary`/`colors.gold`/etc. Don't reintroduce inline style objects for anything Tailwind can express; the one legitimate exception is a handful of components with genuinely runtime-variable values Tailwind's JIT can't see (`Grid.jsx`'s `minWidth`/`gap`, `Spinner.jsx`'s `size`) — those stay inline on purpose, commented as such.

**Design language**: YouTube-style for browsing (Home, Search, ChannelPage's video tab — thumbnail grid, sticky top nav, collapsible sidebar). Medium-style for reading (Books, Articles, Biography — centered `max-w-reading` column, generous whitespace). Logo is a hand-authored SVG lighthouse mark (`منارة` = "lighthouse/beacon") at `src/assets/logo.svg`, also used as `public/favicon.svg`.

## File structure

```
src/
  assets/       logo.svg
  components/
    ui/         Button, Card, Input, Modal, Badge, Grid, Spinner, EmptyState, Avatar — barrel export via index.js
    layout/     Navbar, SideBar, PageShell — barrel export via index.js
    content/    VideoCard, BookCard, ArticleCard, VideoPlayer, CommentsSection — barrel export via index.js
    admin/      5 CMS tab components — barrel export via index.js (see "Known gaps" — currently unrouted)
  pages/        route-level components
  hooks/        useContents, useBooks, useAdminData, useParallelUpload
  contexts/     AuthContext
  lib/
    api/        client.js (axios instance + interceptors), auth.js, contents.js (thin per-domain wrappers)
    env.js       API_BASE_URL / STREAM_BASE_URL, from VITE_API_BASE_URL env var (no more hardcoded localhost:8080)
    media.js     resolveMediaUrl(), extractYouTubeId(), youtubeThumbnail() — shared, don't reimplement per-component
```
Path alias `@/` → `src/` (configured in `vite.config.js`). Import from a component folder's `index.js` (e.g. `import { Button, Card } from '@/components/ui'`), not the individual file, unless there's a specific reason not to.

## `PageShell`

Shared app shell (`components/layout/PageShell.jsx`) wrapping `Navbar` + collapsible `SideBar` (mobile drawer) + a `<main>`. Most browsing pages should render `<PageShell contentClassName="...">{children}</PageShell>` rather than hand-rolling `<Navbar/><SideBar/><main>` — pages that don't want a sidebar pass `sidebar={false}` (used by the Medium-style reading pages and auth forms).

## Comment auth model

Comments (top-level and replies) require login. `userName`/`userEmail` are **derived server-side from the JWT**, never trusted from the request body — this was a deliberate security fix (previously anyone could post as any name, including impersonating "Admin"). `CommentsSection.jsx` shows a "سجّل الدخول" prompt instead of a comment form when logged out; don't reintroduce free-text name/email inputs.

## Owner content management (videos only, so far)

- Sidebar has a distinct "قنواتي" (My Channels) section (via `GET /channels/my-channels`) separate from subscriptions and "اكتشف قنوات أخرى" (discover) — each list excludes items already shown in the others.
- `Home.jsx` fetches the viewer's owned channels and builds a `channelId → slug` map. `VideoCard` receives `isOwner`/`onToggleVisibility`/`onDelete` props and, when the viewer owns that video's channel, shows an eye/eye-off and delete icon directly on the thumbnail (always-visible, not hover-gated — this was raised as a possible UX concern but the hover-only change was never actually implemented, so don't assume it happened). A hidden video also shows a "مخفي" badge.
- `ChannelManage.jsx`'s Videos/Books/Articles tabs each show a full list of that channel's content (visible + hidden) with the same toggle/delete controls — this is the one place all three content types get this treatment; Books/Articles don't have it on their own public listing pages the way Home does for videos.

## Home feed & related videos (deliberately non-addictive)

`Home.jsx`'s default view ("الكل" / no category selected) is a **bounded, non-paginated** three-section feed via `useFeed()` (`hooks/useContents.js` → `GET /api/feed`): "من القنوات التي تتابعها" (subscribed channels), "اقتراحات لك" (discover — same categories as your subscriptions, other channels), "استكشف" (featured picks). This is a fixed snapshot, not an infinite scroll — no "load more" on any of the three sections, no autoplay, no watch-history-driven ranking. That's intentional, not a missing feature: the explicit design goal (see backend `CLAUDE.md`'s `feed` package notes) is a platform that suggests useful related content without becoming an engagement-optimized, hard-to-put-down feed. Selecting a category chip switches to the old plain paginated `useInfiniteContents(...)` browsing (unchanged) — that's the user deliberately choosing to keep looking, so pagination there is fine.

`VideoDetail.jsx` shows a bounded "قد يعجبك أيضاً" related-videos row via `useRelatedContent(id)` (`GET /api/contents/{id}/related`) — same category, capped, no autoplay/next-video chaining. Same reasoning: recommend, don't hook.

## Known gaps

- The 5 admin CMS tab components (`VideosTab`/`BooksTab`/`ArticlesTab`/`DashboardTab`/`BiographyTab`) are fully built but **not wired into any route** — `Admin.jsx` (the page actually routed at `/admin`) is a separate, simpler stats+channel-approval dashboard. The Navbar's "رفع" (Upload) link points to `/upload`, which isn't a registered route.
- No git repository as of the last check — if one still doesn't exist, that's worth flagging to the user rather than assuming.

## Build / verify

```
npm run dev      # localhost:5173
npm run build    # ALWAYS run before trusting a session's changes
```
`npm run build` (Rollup) does full static import/export resolution and will catch things `npm run dev` (esbuild, lazy) won't — e.g. an imported named export that doesn't actually exist in the package. This exact class of bug (a `lucide-react` icon that didn't exist in the installed version) once broke the entire app with a blank white screen on every page, because `App.jsx` statically imports every page up front rather than lazy-loading per route — one bad import anywhere breaks the whole module graph on load. `npm run build` catches it in ~1.5s; a dev-mode HMR log won't.

Backend must be running (see its own `CLAUDE.md`) on `localhost:8080` for the app to have real data — `VITE_API_BASE_URL` env var overrides this if needed.
